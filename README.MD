# Personal Sleep Lab

Personal Sleep Lab is a project designed to help monitor sleep-related activity, including sleeping positions, snoring, breathing patterns, and movement frequency in a local machine or local cloud. 

The project is being developed in stages, with a Python-based backend at its core.

## Project Goals

- Monitor sleep behavior locally

- Capture and analyze sound, movement, and video data

- Provide visual insights through a frontend dashboard

- Maintain user privacy by keeping data stored locally

## Technology Stack

- Backend: Python

- Frontend: To be developed (graphs, dashboards, and visualizations) potentially in React

- Data Sources: Audio recordings, video recordings, motion data

## Development Roadmap
### Stage 1 : Sound Recording and Storage

Record audio during sleep sessions

Store sound data locally for later analysis

### Stage 2: Frontend with Noise & Snoring Graphs

Visualize sound levels over time

Identify and highlight snoring events

### Stage 3: Video Recording and Storage

Capture video during sleep

Store recordings securely on the local system

### Stage 4: Computer Vision Analysis

Track movement frequency

Detect sleeping positions

Maybe Track Eye Movements if possible

### Stage 5: Frontend Upgrade

Display video-based insights

Combine audio and video analytics into a single dashboard with overlays

## Status

🚧 Work in Progress on Stage 1 at the moment — The project is currently under active development, starting with backend audio recording features.
